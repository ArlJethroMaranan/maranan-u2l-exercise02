### Steps on how to create a Github Page
1. Clone remote repository to local computer and place HTML and CSS files in that folder.
2. Add, commit, and push changes made.
3. After these changes are made, in the remote repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**, then under **Build and Deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**, and under **Branch**, select the main branch and select **/ (root)**, then save.
4. After a few minutes, the site will be live.

### Key Takeaways
My main key takeaways from this exercise are the basics of HTML and CSS. Seeing how I've tried creating my website portfolio, this exercise shows how vast the results of web programming can be.
